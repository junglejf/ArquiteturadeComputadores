__________________________________________

Batari Basic is free and fully redistributable for non-commercial purposes.
We are still trying to figure out the best license for this software, but Batari Basic
will always be free.  You can do whatever you want with Batari BASIC except sell it.
You may also create derivative works from the source however you wish, but you must also provide
these for free.

Atari 2600 games created with Batari BASIC are exempt from the above rules, however.  You may make 
cartridges of any games you write with Batari BASIC and sell them, provided someone out there will buy 
them, that is.

______________________________________
First and foremost: Why did I do this?

Answer: Batari BASIC is intended as a beginner's platform so that one may
become accustomed to the intricacies of the system.  Although Batari BASIC
is a viable development platform on its own, its real purpose is as a
stepping stone toward 2600 programming using assembly language. 

Batari BASIC "lowers the bar" so that others with limited programming
experience can write games that can run on a real Atari 2600 or an
emulator. 

Although Batari BASIC uses a "canned" kernel which displays two player
objects of any height, two missiles of any height, an asymmetric
playfield, and a 6-digit score, the sources are included such that one may
learn from them, and possibly even write one's own kernel for use with the
compiler.  Note also that it is also possible to adapt existing kernels to
work with Batari BASIC. 

Batari BASIC is a DOS program but is written in C, so it can easily be 
compiled for any platform.  Soon a Mac OSX port will be available, but 
for now you can download the source code and compile it on nearly any 
platform that has a suitable C compiler.

HOW IT WORKS
_____________

Batari BASIC compiles a BASIC program written as a text file and converts
it to an assembly-language program in DASM syntax.  DASM is a free 6502 assembler.  The DOS version of 
DASM is included with Batari BASIC and will be as long as the folks who wrote DASM don't tell me to 
quit including it.  If you are using something other than DOS, you should download DASM for your platform.

After Batari BASIC has generated an assembly file, it invokes DASM to convert the assembly-language to a
binary that will run on an emulator or can be burned onto an EPROM and played on a real Atari 2600. 

The two-step compilation was done for two reasons: 

1.  It was easier to do this way.
2.  This will hopefully encourage beginning programmers to look at the assembly-language program created by Atari 2600 BASIC so that they may see how it was translated, and ultimately so that they may learn how to write in assembly directly.

About this version
______________________________________________________________________

This is Alpha version 0.2.  It is fully functional but likely contains
bugs.  If you find any bugs, please report them to me at c9r@hotmail.com 
and include "batari" somewhere in the subject line.

To learn how to use Batari Basic, please refer to FAQ, the help file 
(help.html) and the User's Guide, all included in this release.

RUNNING THE COMPILER:
_____________________

Extract the contents of the zip file to a new directory.  The name of the directory doesn't matter.

If you need to compile the source and are using a C compiler that supports makefiles, simply typing 
"make" will compile it.  It has been compiled successfully on Linux and Mac OSX without any issues, and 
probably just about any other platform will work.

Batari Basic is a DOS program which must run at the command line.  However, if you prefer to use 
Windows only, Atari Age user Attendo has written a Windows-based interface that will run the compiler 
for you, plus run an emulator so you can immediately see the results of your program.  The interface, 
called 2600IDE, also contains a sprite editor so you can easily design player sprites for use with 
Batari BASIC.  2600IDE is available at the Batari BASIC homepage.

The easiest way to run Atari 2600 BASIC is to use the included batch file (2600basic.bat.)  This is because the batch file will automatically do 3 things for you:

1. Run the Atari 2600 BASIC compiler.
2. Concatenate the provided assembly files with the one generated by step 1.
3. Run DASM with the proper parameters to create a binary that will run on an emulator or a real 2600.

To run the batch file, simply type:

2600basic <filename>

where filename is the name of the BASIC source file you wish to compile.  A sample file is included for
you to test your setup, called sample.bas.  To test this, type: 

2600basic sample.bas

If successful, a file called sample.bas.bin will be generated that you can run on an emulator.  That the
sample program is not very interesting, but note how simple it was to write... Open sample.bas in a text
editor and take a look at how it was written. 

Revision History
________________

Major changes:

score calculation improved.
slight kernel improvements
alphanumeric labels allowed, and labels/linenumbers are now optional.
blank lines allowed

fixed bug in inline asm where it was impossible to add labels
one boolean now allowed in an if-then (&&,||)
ability to access individual bits
fixed bug where return command wasn't recognized
for-next loops added
vastly improved parser - not nearly as sensitive to spacing
dim statement for alternate variable names
Upon compilation, DASM shows bytes free in ROM
removed exotic illegal opcodes that would cause problems in some emulators, like PCAE
Included files are now in cr/lf format to patch a limitation of DASM
fixed various bugs in pfpixel and pfhline routines
on....goto added
